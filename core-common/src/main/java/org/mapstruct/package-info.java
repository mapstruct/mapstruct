/**
 * <p>
 * MapStruct is a code generator which simplifies the implementation of mappings between Java bean types by generating
 * mapping code at compile time, following a convention-over-configuration approach. The generated code uses plain
 * method invocations and thus is fast and type-safe.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This package contains several annotations which allow to configure how mapper interfaces are generated.
