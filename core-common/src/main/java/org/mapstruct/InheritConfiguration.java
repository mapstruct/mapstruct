/**
 * Advises the code generator to apply the configuration (as given via {@link Mapping}, {@link IterableMapping} etc.)
 * from another mapping method (declared on the same mapper type) or prototype method (declared on a mapper config class
 * referenced via {@link Mapper#config()}) to the annotated method as well.
 * <p>
 * If no method can be identified unambiguously as configuration source (i.e. several candidate methods with matching
 * source and target type exist), the name of the method to inherit from must be specified via {@link #name()}.
 * <p>
 * A typical use case is annotating an update method so it inherits all mappings from a corresponding "standard" mapping
 * method:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * &#64;Mappings({
 *     &#64;Mapping(target="make", source="brand"),
 *     &#64;Mapping(target="seatCount", source="numberOfSeats")
 * })
 * CarDto carToCarDto(Car car);
 *
 * &#64;InheritConfiguration
 * void updateCarDto(Car car, &#64;MappingTarget CarDto carDto);
 * </code>
 * </pre>
