/**
 * This wrapper handles the situation were an assignment must be done via a target getter method because there
 * is no setter available.
 *
 * The wrapper checks if there is an collection or map initialized on the target bean (not null). If so it uses the
 * addAll (for collections) or putAll (for maps). The collection / map is cleared in case of a pre-existing target
 * {@link org.mapstruct.MappingTarget }before adding the source entries. The goal is that the same collection / map
 * is used as target.
 *
 * Nothing can be added if the getter on the target returns null.
