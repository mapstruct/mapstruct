# Contributing to the development of MapStruct

You love MapStruct but miss a certain feature? You found a bug and want to report it, or even better, fix it yourself? That's great! MapStruct is all open source and your help is highly appreciated.

* Source code: [http://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct](http://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct)
* Issue tracker: [https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/issues](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/issues)
* Discussions: Join the [mapstruct-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/mapstruct-users) Google group
* CI build: [https://travis-ci.org/mapstruct/mapstruct/](https://travis-ci.org/mapstruct/mapstruct/)

MapStruct follows the _Fork & Pull_ development approach. To get started just fork the [MapStruct repository](http://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct) to your GitHub account and create a new topic branch for each change. Once you are done with your change, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) against the MapStruct repo.

When doing changes, keep the following best practices in mind:

* Provide test cases
* Use the code formatter for your IDE
  * [IntelliJ Formatter](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/blob/master/etc/mapstruct.xml)
* Update the [reference documentation](mapstruct.org/documentation) on [mapstruct.org](mapstruct.org) where required
* Discuss new features you'd like to implement at the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/mapstruct-users) before getting started
* Create one pull request per feature
* Provide a meaningful history, e.g. squash intermediary commits before submitting a pull request
